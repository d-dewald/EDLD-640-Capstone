This week I made progress in fixing the sentiment analysis and running a k nearest neighbors model w/ rank ordered outcomes coded to my pedagogy text data--I have run into some issues with each of these things however, so I plan to stay after and ask Cengiz about some errors that I'm getting. In terms of revisions, I thought the manuscript frame that Rebecca shared last week was really cool and I'd like to integrate that into my project if possible, as a part of the final product. Over the next few weeks, I plan to finish writing the manuscript, and make decisions on displaying the figures and analyses within the paper.
