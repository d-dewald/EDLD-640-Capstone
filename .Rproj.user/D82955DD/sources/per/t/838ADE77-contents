- [A] Progress this week
    - created project: https://github.com/d-dewald/EDLD-640-Capstone
    - preliminary analyses (available in 'plots' folder on github)
    - created list of new text samples (see B below), available in 'data' folder on github
- [B] Revisions to product
    - text sample size smaller than anticipated(n=155); so I will incorporate additional pedagogy examples from pre-existing studies for text analysis
- [C] Plan for next week & beyond
     - organize child outcome data (total play time, time w/ target function, # properties discovered)
     - continue organizing pedagogy data (see B above)
     - train initial ML model predicting outcomes (above) based upon pedagogy-type
